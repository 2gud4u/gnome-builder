Version 3.16.3
==============

Your Builder development team has been working hard to build on the
tremendous momentum of the last few months. 3.16.3 is like each of it's
predecessors, packed with new features and bug fixes.

I'd like to personally thank everyone who contributed bugs during the cycle.
You keep us on our toes.

This release shows a sharp spike in contributions from new and existing
GNOME community members. I'm very happy to see this happening and look
forward to building Builder together.

Of note in this release:

 • A new source code minimap, recently pushed upstream into GtkSourceView.
 • A new greeter based on recent design work.
 • A new XML highlighter to highlight matching XML elements.
 • Support for ctags-based auto-completion.
 • High-performance, mutli-threaded counters that can be enabled with
   --enable-rdtscp. These are disabled by default as they require newer
   Intel Core i[357] features. ide-list-counters can be used to extract
   them from a running or crashed process.
 • The preferences interface has been vastly improved.
 • Search improvements.
 • A strftime format completion provider for Python.
 • Additional emacs, vim, and default keybindings.
 • Experimental support for building autotools projects with mingw.
 • Python auto-indenter improvements.
 • Many CSS style improvements on Adwaita.
 • Additional support for recursive-automake-based projects.
 • Some features have made configurable with gsettings.
 • Layered settings support for project vs global settings.
 • Improved modelines support.
 • Support for parsing DOAP files.
 • Various memory leaks were plugged.
 • Incremental highlighting has more aggressive invalidation.
 • Various race conditions in autotools support were fixes.
 • OpenBSD and FreeBSD build system fixes.
 • Many translation improvements.
 • libide-1.0.so and Ide-1.0.typelib are now installed to a private
   directory.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release!

Version 3.16.2
==============

Based on early feedback from 3.16.1, I'm announcing a followup release.
This is primarily a bug-fix release.

 • Fix double free in dummy vcs.
 • Fix project tree loading in dummy vcs.
 • Fix workbench action names in emacs mode.
 • Improve sorting of filenames in project tree.
 • Ensure loading of files matching content types supported by
   GtkSourceLanguage.
 • Enable project tree by default.
 • Enable project tree icons by default.
 • Add rename file in project tree.
 • Add move to trash in project tree.
 • Sort previously opened projects before projects discovered by miners.
 • Use sysconf() for page size (fixes building on OpenBSD).
 • Various clang build fixes.
 • Use arrow down instead of hamburger for search bar.
 • Fix unicode in markdown live preview.

Thanks to everyone that tested 3.16.1 and provided feedback!

Version 3.16.1
==============

GNOME 3.16.1 is here, and so is a new release of Builder!

While most projects are focused on improving stability for 3.16.1, Builder is
quickly adding the features you need. This is only possible because we are
still an early preview application.

Some highlights of the over 300 new commits in this release:

 • Improved project tree including support for creating files and folders,
   opening with external programs based on content-type, and file-manager
   integration. (Christian Hergert, Garrett Regier)
 • A new incremental semantic syntax highlighting engine.
 • Semantic highlighting for C and C++ using Clang AST.
 • Document selection popover to ease switching between documents.
 • Symbols navigator for C and C++ files.
 • Apply "Fix-It" for C and C++ as provided by Clang.
 • Highlight build warnings in squiggly yellow lines.
 • Improvements to dark theme.
 • Improvements to Builder's style scheme for C and C++ languages.
 • "Jump to definition" support for C and C++ languages.
   Ctrl+] or gd in vim mode, <alt>period in emacs mode.
 • A new project selection and creation dialog on startup.
 • Git clone support from new project dialog.
 • "Find other file" similar to emacs to switch between source and header
   files in C and C++.
 • Improvements to scroll-offset which allows you to keep a given number
   of lines above and below the cursor. (Carlos Soriano, Christian Hergert)
 • Respect Gtk's "sort-directories-first" GSetting. (Garrett Regier)
 • Improvements to VIM mode including support for :bnext, :bprevious,
   :buffers and :ls (Alexandre Franke, Sebastien Lafargue)
 • Split support for HTML view (Sebastien Lafargue)
 • Build fixes for FreeBSD (Ting-Wei Lan)
 • Build fixes for OpenBSD (Antoine Jacoutot)
 • Support for editing "application/x-php" files.
 • Support extraction of CFLAGS from out-of-tree, non-recursive automake.
   (Christian Hergert, Giovanni Campagna)
 • A new symbolic icon (Jakub Steiner)
 • Improvements to handling of drafts (Paolo Borelli)
 • Improvements to autotools builders (Paolo Borelli)
 • Many translation updates including Czech, Polish, and Hebrew.
   (Marek Černocký, Piotr Drąg, and Yosef Or Boczko)

I'd like to thank everyone that filed bugs, submitted patches, translated,
tested, or plans to test Builder.

Together, great things are possible.

Version 3.16.0
==============

It is my distinct pleasure to announce the first preview release of
GNOME Builder!

GNOME Builder is a new development environment being developed in
conjunction with the GNOME desktop. While Builder is an alpha product,
it is under heavy development. We look forward to early testers and
encourage everyone to try things out and file bugs and feature requests.

I'd like to thank the Gedit and GtkSourceView team for all of their hard
work integrating features from Builder upstream as well as adding
features we needed. Additionally the GLib and Gtk+ teams were incredibly
helpful to keep us moving.

Builder is built in conjunction with LibIDE. This new shared library
provides the necessary abstractions to build a modern IDE. It includes
auto-completion, auto-indenters, buffer management, a source editor,
abstractions for build systems, version control, file settings,
translation units, diagnostics, symbols, search engines, snippets, local
and external devices, documentation, animations, and more.

Some highlights of this release are:

 · A beautiful new GtkSourceView theme influenced by design grid paper.
 · Integrated source editor based on GtkSourceView.
 · Live diagnostics as you type for C, C++ via Clang.
 · Live diagnostics as you type for Python, Ruby, CSS, JavaScript, JSON,
   Vala, Go, and others via gnome-code-assistance.
 · Highlighting of added/changed lines within the source editor.
 · Robust Vim and Emacs emulation.
 · Multiple views into single file. Both horizontal and vertical splits
   are supported.
 · Navigation history to jump back and forward within modified files.
 · Robust snippet engine including support for GLib 2.44 style GObjects.
 · Quick search to locate files within your project as well as
   documentation in devhelp.
 · Smart backspace to simplify using spaces instead of tabs.
 · A command bar to execute internal GActions and Vim style commands
   with autocompletion.
 · An implementation of Vim's scrolloffset.
 · Restoration of insertion cursor when reloading a file.
 · Autocompletion based on current words in loaded buffers.
 · Experimental support for autocompletion based on clang.
 · Support for vim, emacs, and kate style modelines.
 · Editorconfig support.
 · Experimental read-only support for autoconf/automake based build
   systems.
 · Robust auto-indenters for GNU C89, Python, and XML.
 · Experimental project tree (available via F9).
 · Experimental support for building automake based projects.
 · Keybinding replay for command repeat in Vim emulation.
 · Autosaving of modified buffers, never lose a change.
 · Scripting via Python (CPython) or JavaScript (Gjs) and GObject
   Introspection.
 · Dynamic power management when running on laptop battery.
 · HTML and Markdown live preview.
 · Autocompletion of g_date_time_format() format parameters.
 · Type ahead search with rubberbanding.

We wont be slowing down any time soon. Thanks to everyone for your
support, I cannot wait for what is ahead.

This is the first preview release of Builder as we continue our journey to
GNOME 3.16!

Being that this is such an early release, we'd really appreciate it if you
took the time to file bugs as you find them.
