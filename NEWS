==============
Version 3.25.3
==============

This release includes some major changes for packagers. Builder is now built
using the Meson build system. Given the number of GNOME packages following this
trend, chances are that packagers will have existing scripts to help make this
a smooth transition.

Changes since 3.25.2

 • The "egg" contrib package has been broken out into libdazzle. If you do
   not have libdazzle, it will be built as a subproject.
   http://git.gnome.org/browse/libdazzle
 • The "jsonrpc-glib" contrib package has been broken out into a standalone
   project. It will be built as a subproject if you do not have it installed.
   http://git.gnome.org/browse/jsonrpc-glib
 • The "template-glib" contrib package has been broken out into a standalone
   project. It will be built as a subproject if you do not have it installed.
   http://git.gnome.org/browse/template-glib
 • Ctags completion priority has been lowered
 • Many internals have been moved to an updated libdazzle. This includes lots
   of theming fixes as well as improved panels and theming integration. Many
   search data structures were also broken out into libdazzle.
 • The search provider has been rewritten to use libdazzle and the new
   suggestion entry. We expect more changes here before 3.26.
 • Builder now uses GVFS metadata to store the cursor position. This should
   improve the chances you end up on the right position when re-opening a
   buffer.
 • Panels now properly maintain their visibility state between runs of Builder.
 • The flatpak plugin now properly ignores runtimes ending in ".Sources".
 • Builder properly cleans up drafts fixing an issue where files with encoding
   errors would continually re-open when restoring Builder's internal state.
 • A "counters" window has been added to aide in debugging.
 • Builder now tries to do significantly less work while the buffer is opening.
   This should speed up file-loading on larger files.
 • Various async operation priority have been lowered to avoid stalling the
   Gtk main loop.
 • UI files now strip their empty space which should reduce the size of libide
   a small amount.
 • IdePerspective now has a restore_state vfunc. This helps ensure that the
   widget restores state after the UI has settled. This can help avoid hickups
   in the UI at startup.
 • Python Ide.py overrides now have helpers to log using g_warning() etc. See
   Ide.warning(), Ide.debug(), Ide.critical(), etc.
 • Additional documentation.

==============
Version 3.25.1
==============

The road to 3.26 has begun, and 3.25.1 is here to kick that off.

 • A new retab plugin to reindent your source code.
 • Auto-save can now be configured.
 • A new notification plugin to notify of build completion.
 • Preview support for Sphinx.
 • Improved jump support in the editor.
 • The "install" action can be run from the command-bar to install
   your project without running.
 • Word completion minimum length can now be configured.
 • Ctags improvements.
 • A save button has been added to the Build Log.
 • Release auto-save timeout after a manual save to reduce the
   number of file-system operations.
 • Allow jhbuild from alternate PATHs.
 • Animation improvements, including support for animating based on
   screen DPI and physical space. This has the potential to make
   animations smoother, but may cause issues with miss-reporting
   EDID information. Mitigations are provided.
 • Do not download SDKs or dependencies when on metered connections.
   This can be disabled in preferences.
 • Bump vala requirement to 0.38.
 • The editor now supports text-wrapping but is not enabled by default
   due to the performance penalty.
 • Plugins are discovered in ~/.local/share/gnome-builder/plugins, even
   when distributed under Flatpak.
 • Don't take into account failed or cancelled transfers when calculating
   transfer progress.
 • Various build tooling widgetry will become insensitive while the build
   pipeline is not useable.
 • Language Server Protocol improvements.
 • Various memory leaks and bug fixes.
