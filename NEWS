==============
Version 3.22.2
==============

Summary of changes since 3.22.1

 * Flatpak builds of Builder can now target a Flatpak runtime when building
   the project. More work is ongoing to support running your project with
   flatpak runtimes.
 * Translation improvements
 * More RTL improvements
 * Lots of memory leak fixes found with ASAN
 * Builder will now cleanup the makecache directory for old temporary files
   that could have been left behind.
 * Flatpak breakout subprocess fixes to allow synchronous use from main
   loop. This fixes potential lockups in Flatpak'd versions of Builder.
 * The diagnostic engine has been restructured to allow out-of-band
   updates to diagnostics.
 * Create-project now depends on git, as it uses git to initialize a
   new project.
 * GObject Introspection improvements.
 * Improve performance of diagnostic creation under heavy use. This fixes
   a main-loop stall when extracting thousands of diagnostics from a
   project.
 * Diagnostics panel has been changed to use GtkTreeView to support larger
   lists of diagnostics as found in some projects.
 * Add empty-state views for symbols and diagnostic panels.
 * Sysprof support includes visualizers, zoom, and selectable ranges.
 * Ctags can now be used to build symbol trees, including Python
 * IdeSubprocessSupervisor has been added to allow plugins to easily
   manage an external process.
 * A client has been added for "Language Server Protocol" to make writing
   language-server based plugins easy.
 * Support for the Meson and Cargo build systems have been added.
   Run support with Meson will require 0.36.0 of Meson.
 * Deprecation fixes for various deprecated gtk+ API.
 * Runtimes have been improved to hook into the application build process.
 * Vim support has been improved to better support counts to change operations.
 * Build and runtime improvements for editorconfig.
 * Handle alt+0..n properly during auto-completion.
 * Builder now depends on json-glib-1.0. This was already likely required
   via dependencies before, but now is explicit.

3.22.2 also includes a technology preview for Rust support. You can try
this out by installing Rust nightly and the “rustls” package for integrated
diagnostics, auto-completion, and sybmol-tree support.

There have also been a bunch of translation updates this cycle. Thanks to all
of our translators since 3.22.1:  Dušan Kazik, Aurimas Černius, Balázs Meskó,
Benedikt M. Thoma, ChenYang Li, Kjartan Maraas, Marek Černocký, Mario
Blättermann, Piotr Drąg, Rafael Fontenelle

==============
Version 3.22.1
==============

Summary of changes since 3.22.0

 • Lots of widget layout fixes for RTL languages such as Hebrew.
 • Build system fixes (missing -lm on some platforms, fixes for pipe2
   on macOS).
 • Use “getent passwd” to get the current passwd when discovering
   preferred user shell.
 • Load both user and system installed flatpak runtimes.
 • Add support for Sysprof Visualizers (requires Sysprof 3.22.1)
 • Add empty, failed, and recording states for Sysprof plugin.
 • Prefer GtkNativeFileChooser when applicable.
 • Support for running some GJS projects using autotools. In particular
   we try to discover the “GJS template” Makefile.am style.
 • Fix gettext usage from Python plugins.
 • The preferences perspective is now more tolerant of smaller screen
   sizes such as 1280xH.
 • Various UI polish.
 • Lots of translation updates.

==============
Version 3.22.0
==============

GNOME 3.22.0 is here and GNOME Builder is no different.

Since 3.21.91, we've added a bunch of features to help Builder run better under
Flatpak.

 • Fixes improper invalidation of cache items like clang translation units.
 • New transfers API for plugins.
 • Support for prebuild/postbuild commands in .buildconfig.
 • Run terminals on the host system when contained in Flatpak.
 • Teach runtimes to run on the host system when necessary. Builder, when
   running under Flatpak, can support using your host jhbuild now.
 • Plugins can define if a process should run on the host with the
   IdeSubprocessLauncher:run-on-host property.
 • Various UI stablization fixes.
 • Add Build and Run keybindings to Shortcut window (Ekta Nandwani)
 • Fix running autotools targets with relative paths (Patrick Griffis)
 • Fix running projects using GSettings (Patrick Griffis)

===============
Version 3.21.91
===============

Another incremental release as we work towards GNOME 3.22.

 • Build system improvements (Andreas Henriksson, Kalev Lember)
 • A new "Quick Highlight" plugin to highlight words matching the
   current selection (Martin Blanchard)
 • New snippets for GJS have been added (Philip Chimento)
 • Incremental gstyle/colorpicker improvements (Sebastien Lafargue)
 • A new "Transfers API" has landed but is not yet used by any
   components. This will be useful for plugins that involve download
   or upload operations, such as those to a physical device.
 • SCSS files are mapped to CSS for gnome-code-assistance.
 • Sysprof support is now automatically detected.
 • The devhelp search provider has been removed as it was
   better served via the Ctrl+Shift+F accelerator.
 • Builder now prefers the project id (sanitized name) in more
   places such as directory names which should improve building some
   projects.
 • The create-project workflow will now check to see if a directory
   exists before progressing the workflow.
 • The C, XML, and HTML indenters have been improved to respect the
   language indentation settings for tab vs spaces and indent-width.

And thanks to our translators!

==============
Version 3.21.1
==============

This is our starting point for the 3.22 cycle.

This release is mostly the same as 3.20.2 except that it has an updated color
palette for the Adwaita theme in GTK+ 3.21.1.

Cheers!

==============
Version 3.20.2
==============

We've packed a bunch of bug fixes into a new release for you.

We strongly suggest that distributions upgrade to 3.20.2 if
they have already shipped 3.20.0 as it fixes numerous issues.

 • You can now select templates when creating a project, including
   C, C++, and Vala languages.
 • The Vala plugin now extracts --pkg command line arguments from
   autotools projects.
 • Various bug fixes to preferences and gsettings.
 • Much more of builder is translatable now.
 • Build for FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
 • Fixes to vim movements.
 • Many performance improvements to the editor.
 • Support for LLVM 3.8.
 • Fixes for ctrl+click on included headers to jump to header.
 • Fix for infinite loop in worker thread when cloning from
   unauthorized git repositories.
 • Builder removes unnecessary widgets after starting up, lowering
   the runtime overhead of the workbench.
 • You can move rename files outside their current directory.
 • Fixes for shorthand git URLs such as user@host:path.
 • The global file search now handles renames and deletes of
   project files.
 • The project window now includes the title of the project
   to help when multiple projects are open in GNOME Shell's
   overview.
 • Some projects that could not be removed from the greeter
   can now be removed.

We also request that packages ensure that they ensure that the Builder
package depends on automake, autoconf, and libtool. These will always
be available when building, but are also required at runtime for
autotools support.

Thanks to all our translators and contributors in this release!

==============
Version 3.20.0
==============

GNOME 3.20 has finally arrived, and Builder is here to help you
write great software!

A lot of stability improvements have landed since 3.19.90, as well
as merging the beginning of our new panel engine. While Builder
shouldn't look any different with the panel improvements, it lays
the groundwork for us to provide a more powerful panel engine
going forward, including all the features you would expect.

Since our last release, you'll find:

 • More stylability controls using GtkSourceView style schemes.
 • The ability to toggle case-sensitivity with search context
   menus.
 • VIM movement improvements.
 • The ability to disable project miners at startup.
 • Improvements to the clang completion engine.
 • Show empty state screen when last document is closed.
 • Show project tree when last document is closed.
 • Various build system improvements.
 • Improvements to Control+Click on symbols in the editor.
 • Snippet parser improvements.
 • Filtering improvements in symbol tree.
 • Various bugs squashed in menu management.
 • A new comment code plugin.

Thanks to all our contributors since 3.18.1!

Version 3.19.90
===============

GNOME 3.20 is heating up and so is Builder. We've landed a bunch more
features for you since 3.19.4 and are ready for more general testing
while we stablize for the upcoming 3.20 release.

In this release, you'll find:

 • A new diagnostic provider for common gettext errors (Daiki Ueno)
 • Builder no longer bookmarks known temporary directories.
   This should make things less annoying when opening a single
   file with Builder. (Akshaya Kakkilaya)
 • The framework for User Help has landed, and we need your help to
   put together a good help story in Builder! (Alexandre Franke)
 • Terminal styling for Dark Mode has been fixed (Carlos Soriano)

   "xdg-app build"
 • Support for building inside of a jhbuild runtime (Patrick Griffis)
 • Various tooltips were added to the user interface (Piotr Drąg,
   Adrian Zatreanu)
 • The line change gutter got support for rendering deleted lines.
 • Ctags got support for coalescing similar completion results. (chandu)
 • Cursor location history and ctags were moved to .cache directories.
   (Megh Parikh)
 • Libide, Egg, and Template-GLib headers are now installed to
   $(includedir)/gnome-builder-@VERSION@. This allows building C
   and vala plugins out of tree.
 • Support for enabling pylint via GNOME Code Assistance was added.
 • You can search for projects in the greeter using the directory name.
 • An empty state splash was added to the editor.
 • Various workarounds for recent changes in Vala.

==============
Version 3.19.4
==============

It's been far too long since our last release, and things are heating up
for GNOME 3.20. Builder has underone a major overhaul since 3.18 and
still has a few major pieces still to land this cycle.

 • Perspectives have been implemented to allow for clearer groupings
   of application features and plugins.
 • Preferences has undergone substantial redesign. Preferences now
   use a custom perspective rather than a dialog window.
   - There is still an height-for-width bug to resolve in the layout
     of preference items.
 • A new "ide" command exposing various Builder features to command
   line users.
 • Global search has gotten some style cleanup.
 • Builders custom CSS was rewritten for recent gtk+ changes.
 • A build panel has been added.
 • A Todo plugin was added to track todo items.
 • Perspectives can handle URI opening, allowing for perspectives
   such as a "glade perspective" to handle opening .ui files.
 • Builder-1.0.gir was dropped, in favor of Ide-1.0.gir.
 • Embedded plugins and dependency solving now works.
 • Plugin APIs were simplified.
 • Multi-process separation support using IdeWorker. Plugins can now
   easily move work to a subprocess and communicate via D-Bus. Jedi
   has been ported to multi-process mode for Python auto-completion.
 • Lots of Vim-mode improvements.
 • Vala plugin improvements.
 • External plugins are now supported.
 • Plugins can be loaded and unloaded.
 • Loads of bug and build system fixes.
 • Project greeter and project creation have been rewritten for
   perspectives.
 • Plugins now have automatic resources for menus.ui and css themes.
 • Various keybinding improvements.
 • Control+click works for navigating to type definitions.
 • scrolloffset has much improved and gained support for negative
   values, which works in the opposite direction (top down).
 • Search movements have been simplified.

And much, much more!

Please help us shake out the bugs by running Builder and reporting
bugs to bugzilla.gnome.org.


==============
Version 3.18.1
==============

Just like the 3.16 cycle, we are moving fast despite the dot release
nature of this cycle. We have a lot to get done and we want our lovely
users helping us test this young program.

A short list of updates since 3.18.0:

 • Initial support for Vala. Until we move this out of process, we do
   expect that things are a bit leaky. This plugin is written in Vala
   and requires libvala-0.30. It supports autocompletion, as-you-type
   error highlighting, a symbol tree, and jump to definition. We would
   love for the vala community continue helping make this plugin great.
 • You can now write plugins in Vala. *.vapi are generated for libide-1.0
   and gnome-builder-1.0.
 • Autocompletion, in most scenarios, will be much faster. Check out
   https://blogs.gnome.org/chergert/2015/10/05/post-guadec-catchup/ for
   more information on how this was done.
 • Most autocompletion engines now support fuzzy completion. This means
   that "gtkwidshow" will match "gtk_widget_show".
 • A few crashers were fixed.
 • --enable-*-plugin now works correctly.
 • Content type loading was fixed so that Makefile.am are no longer opened
   by totem.
 • Python jedi completion has been improved.
 • Fix some coverity warnings.
 • A new button has been added to the editor to jump to the next warning
   or error.
 • The C indenter is a bit more friendly to alternate coding styles.
 • Reindent line support has landed (tab in emacs, == in vim, ctrl+alt+i
   as default).
 • A new font for the overview map has been enabled. It is called BuilderBlocks
   and is a generic block font based on Tofu from Behdad Esfahbod.
 • The ctags plugin can now defer tags generation to automakes `make ctags`.
 • You can now draw marks for spaces, tabs, newlines, non-breaking whitespace,
   trailing and leading spaces.
 • Many translation updates including (French, Hungarian, Kazakh, Korean,
   Spanish, Finnish, Esperanto, Czech, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish,
   German, and Serbian).
 • Improvements to the search workflow.
 • Various vim and emacs compatability and stability improvements.
 • Jedi completion proposals now show the correct word and lower probability
   of functions that start with __.
 • Symbol tree panel stability improvements.


Thanks to all of our more than 20 contributors since 3.18.0!


==============
Version 3.18.0
==============

GNOME 3.18 is here, and so is Builder!

A short list of updates since 3.17.92:

 • buffer: release symbol resolver aggressively
 • build: disable device manager/mingw plugins by default
 • cindent: ensure we don't loop forever looking for context
 • counters: add vsdo fallback on linux and no rdtscp instruction
 • counters: mask CPU bits from rdtscp instruction on x86_64
 • editor: release underlying document aggressively to prevent leaks
 • editor: <shift>k in vim mode to request documentation
 • editor: add simple goto line popover, activate with ctr+i in gedit mode
 • editor: fix crash upon DnD to editor
 • keybindings: use ctrl+alt+o for global search in gedit mode.
 • map-bin: ignore size adjustment when floating bar is not used
 • plugins: show plugin greyed out if it is disabled
 • search: disable progress bar in search results
 • search: fix popover bug when clearing search text
 • search: make the search entry more forgiving to smaller sizes
 • search: show more search results by default
 • symbol-tree: fix cache timeout to use milliseconds
 • theme: fix styling of view controls in stack header
 • view-stack: allow focusing the view stack by clicking on the header

We have marked the mingw and device manager plugins as experimental because
they are not implemented to the point of being useful. We suggest that
packagers do not ship them as part of the 3.18.0 release.

-- Christian



===============
Version 3.17.92
===============

Another Builder release is here!

This release is a snapshot before the final 3.18 release expected next week.
This gives packages a chance to ensure that everything is in working order
for the 3.18 release.

We'd like to remember everything that Builder is still a beta product and we
are working hard towards implementing all the requested features.

There are lots of changes this cycle, some more infrastructure than cosmetic.
A few of them are as follows:

 • Progress on implementing UI designs.
 • A new shortcuts dialog to help you discover features.
 • A new plugin engine powered by Libpeas. Currently, only in-tree plugins
   are supported. Plugins can be written in C or Python3.
 • A new workspace layout with panels which can be extended by plugins.
 • Completion with support for GObject Introspection for Python3 using Jedi.
 • Progress on device manager and CPU graphs.
 • Symbol tree is now shown in a panel which reduces widget overhead.
 • Loading of previous buffers is faster.
 • Read-only snippets viewer has been added to preferences.
 • Read-only plugin viewer in preferences.
 • Build systems can now be implemented as plugins.
 • Support for Terminals using VTE.
 • Editor overview map has been moved into GtkSourceView.
 • Smart backspace has been moved into GtkSourceView.
 • Builder gained printer support.

Thanks again to all our translators that kept things up to date while we
churned through bugs late in the cycle. We hope to do this less as we come
out of beta.

For those that are *very* adventurous, Builder should compile on OS X now with
a properly configured jhbuild toolchain. Additionally, we have maintained
compatability with FreeBSD and OpenBSD thanks to generous contributions.

Notes to packagers

 • We now install multiple private shared libraries to $prefix/gnome-builder/
 • Plugins are installed to $prefix/gnome-builder/plugins/

I'd like to thank our nearly 40 contributors this cycle for all your patches
and time spent on making Builder great!

-- Christian



==============
Version 3.16.3
==============

Your Builder development team has been working hard to build on the
tremendous momentum of the last few months. 3.16.3 is like each of it's
predecessors, packed with new features and bug fixes.

I'd like to personally thank everyone who contributed bugs during the cycle.
You keep us on our toes.

This release shows a sharp spike in contributions from new and existing
GNOME community members. I'm very happy to see this happening and look
forward to building Builder together.

Of note in this release:

 • A new source code minimap, recently pushed upstream into GtkSourceView.
 • A new greeter based on recent design work.
 • A new XML highlighter to highlight matching XML elements.
 • Support for ctags-based auto-completion.
 • High-performance, mutli-threaded counters that can be enabled with
   --enable-rdtscp. These are disabled by default as they require newer
   Intel Core i[357] features. ide-list-counters can be used to extract
   them from a running or crashed process.
 • The preferences interface has been vastly improved.
 • Search improvements.
 • A strftime format completion provider for Python.
 • Additional emacs, vim, and default keybindings.
 • Experimental support for building autotools projects with mingw.
 • Python auto-indenter improvements.

==============
Version 3.16.1
==============

GNOME 3.16.1 is here, and so is a new release of Builder!

While most projects are focused on improving stability for 3.16.1, Builder is
quickly adding the features you need. This is only possible because we are
still an early preview application.

Some highlights of the over 300 new commits in this release:

 • Improved project tree including support for creating files and folders,
   opening with external programs based on content-type, and file-manager
   integration. (Christian Hergert, Garrett Regier)

 • Semantic highlighting for C and C++ using Clang AST.
 • Document selection popover to ease switching between documents.
 • Symbols navigator for C and C++ files.
 • Apply "Fix-It" for C and C++ as provided by Clang.
 • Highlight build warnings in squiggly yellow lines.
 • Improvements to dark theme.
 • Improvements to Builder's style scheme for C and C++ languages.
 • "Jump to definition" support for C and C++ languages.
   Ctrl+] or gd in vim mode, <alt>period in emacs mode.
 • A new project selection and creation dialog on startup.
 • Git clone support from new project dialog.
 • "Find other file" similar to emacs to switch between source and header
   files in C and C++.

I'd like to thank everyone that filed bugs, submitted patches, translated,
tested, or plans to test Builder.

Together, great things are possible.


==============
Version 3.16.0
==============

It is my distinct pleasure to announce the first preview release of
GNOME Builder!

GNOME Builder is a new development environment being developed in
conjunction with the GNOME desktop. While Builder is an alpha product,
it is under heavy development. We look forward to early testers and
encourage everyone to try things out and file bugs and feature requests.

I'd like to thank the Gedit and GtkSourceView team for all of their hard
work integrating features from Builder upstream as well as adding
features we needed. Additionally the GLib and Gtk+ teams were incredibly
helpful to keep us moving.

Builder is built in conjunction with LibIDE. This new shared library
provides the necessary abstractions to build a modern IDE. It includes
auto-completion, auto-indenters, buffer management, a source editor,
abstractions for build systems, version control, file settings,
translation units, diagnostics, symbols, search engines, snippets, local
and external devices, documentation, animations, and more.

Some highlights of this release are:

 · A beautiful new GtkSourceView theme influenced by design grid paper.
 · Integrated source editor based on GtkSourceView.
 · Live diagnostics as you type for C, C++ via Clang.
 · Live diagnostics as you type for Python, Ruby, CSS, JavaScript, JSON,
   Vala, Go, and others via gnome-code-assistance.
 · Highlighting of added/changed lines within the source editor.
 · Robust Vim and Emacs emulation.
