There are a lot of things that need to be written in Builder and we'd love to have your help in doing so.
Take a look at :ref:`Creating Plugins<creating_plugins>` to learn how to write plugins.
Most things in Builder are implemented as plugins while the scaffolding is written in C and foundin libide_.

Plugins can be written in C, C++, Python, or Vala.

If you're interested in working on ``libide``, the core C library behind Builder, you'll want to peruse the libide_ directory in the code-base.
