To build your project, use the Build Button on the right of the OmniBar as shown in the figure below.

Additionally, you can use ``Control+F7`` to activate a build.

If you prefer the command bar, use ``Control+Enter`` to activate the command bar and type "build" followed by Enter to activate the build command.
