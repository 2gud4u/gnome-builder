Contributing
############

If you're interested in contributing to Builder and GNOME at large, we would love for you to join us!
Only with people like you can GNOME exist.
We love seeing people that use GNOME transform into people that create GNOME.

IRC
===

One great way to get started is to join us on IRC where you can chat with others who work on the Builder project.
The Builder developer team can be found on the `Builder IRC channel`_.

File A Bug
==========

If you think you've found a bug in Builder, head over to `Builder Bug Tracker`_ and file a report.
We will get back to you on any further details we need to track down the issue as soon as we can.
Filing bugs helps us improve the softwrae for everyone and we really appreciate your time.

For various spam reasons our bugtracker requires that you create an account.
We hope this minor inconvenience is not too much trouble.

Find A Bug To Work On
=====================

If you wish to start contributing code to Builder, simply pick a bug from this list of `newcomer bugs`_.

Building From Source
====================

Learn out how to install :ref:`via-jhbuild` in our installation documentation.

Currently, JHBuild is how we recommend contributing to Builder.
We do expect this to change very soon in that you'll be able to easily contribute to Builder from our flatpak-version of Builder.

Improve This Documentation
==========================

One great way to learn about a software project is to try to document it!
Writing great documentation can be both challenging and rewarding.
And writing great documentation requires you learn about the product.

This is one way to improve things for the next person while you explore the code-base.
You can find the documentation in the ``doc/`` directory of the `git repository`_.

Planning And Project Management
===============================

Many of us that work on the Builder code-base are great at writing code.
But we are not so great at managing schedules, planning feature priorities, and coordinating with other projects.
Helping us do this in Builder will make you a shepard of geeks.
