----

Builder attempts to be an IDE for writing software for GNOME. It does not try
to be a generic IDE, but one specialized for writing GNOME software. We believe
this this focus will help us to build something great.

If you would like to help in this effort, join our IRC channel and we will help
you find something to work on.

Builder is written in C, but some aspects of Builder may be written in another
language if it makes sense.
