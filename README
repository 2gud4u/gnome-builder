----

Builder attempts to be an IDE for writing software for GNOME. It does not try
to be a generic IDE, but one specialized for writing GNOME software. We believe
that this focus will help us to build something great.

If you would like to help in this effort, join our IRC channel and we will help
you find something to work on.

Builder is written in C, but some aspects of Builder may be written in another
language if it makes sense.

----

Builder is developed in conjunction with GNOME releases. This means that we
often contribute to, and depend on, features being developed in other GNOME
modules.

Since there has not yet been a stable release of Builder, the easiest way to
get started is to use the development tool jhbuild to install from source.

  git clone git://git.gnome.org/jhbuild.git
  cd jhbuild
  ./autogen.sh
  make
  make install
  jhbuild build gnome-builder
  jhbuild run gnome-builder

We hope to have VM images that can be used for testing in the near future.
